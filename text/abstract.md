Animation has been a major part of the entertainment industry since motionpictures were invented.  Although a relatively recent development, computer animationhas quickly emerged as a dominant medium for many fields, not limited to entertainment.
An interesting problem in animation is the realization of the motion of humansand animals.  There is an abundance of data resulting from the study of human andanimal locomotion, and from these data have arisen several approaches to the animationof locomotion.  These different approaches have had varying levels of success,where success is defined as the amount of realism present in the resulting animation.
A logical way to build an animation controller is to simulate the mechanisms ofthe brain.  This is not a trivial task, since little is known about the function of the brain.The best way to approximate the function of the brain is to utilize neural network models.
Kohonen neural networks are a type of neural network model which is based onthe way in which the brain organizes stimuli.  Given a set of input data, a Kohonennetwork can organize the data in a way that makes the control of animation easy for the userand computationally simple for the computer as well, producing realistic output in real time.
We present a method for using Kohonen self-organizing networks to controlthe animation of human locomotion.  This methodology makes it possible to controlhuman locomotion with a high-level script language and is easily adaptable to provide awide range of motions which are not limited to locomotion.
