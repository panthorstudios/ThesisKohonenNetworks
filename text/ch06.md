##The Perceptron


##teacher

Figure 6-1 shows a basic perceptron processing unit.  The binary inputs arepresented to the perceptron as a vector, a.  Each element of the input vector is multiplied byan associated weight value, w
where
is the value of input i
= the weight associated with the connection to unit j from unit i
A bias term (represented as  in Figure 6-1) is included in the sum, and has aweight associated with it as well.  The bias term is always +1, which provides a threshold forthe perceptron.
The output of the perceptron unit is determined by looking at the sumS
